# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. I designed the website using the Bootstrap framework to create a static web page. The design focuses on minimal color combinations to maintain simplicity and ensure ease of reading and detail comprehension.

## Key Features

- **Mobile Friendly**: The website is optimized for mobile devices, ensuring a seamless user experience across different screen sizes.
- **Theme Selection**: Users have the option to choose from different themes, including auto, dark, and light themes.

## Credits

This project utilizes the following resources:

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): Used for building the responsive layout and styling of the website.
- [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons): Icons sourced from Tabler Icons to enhance the visual elements of the website.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/): Hosted on GitHub, making it easy to collaborate, track changes, and manage the project.

Special thanks to the developers and contributors of Bootstrap, Tabler Icons, and GitHub for their valuable contributions to the open-source community.
