# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. I designed the website using the Bootstrap framework to create a static web page. The design focuses on minimal color combinations to maintain simplicity and ensure ease of reading and detail comprehension.

## Key Features

- **Mobile Friendly**: The website is optimized for mobile devices, ensuring a seamless user experience across different screen sizes.
- **Theme Selection**: Users have the option to choose from different themes, including auto, dark, and light themes.
